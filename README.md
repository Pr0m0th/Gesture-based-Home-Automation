This project is designed with accessibility and ease of use in mind, making it especially beneficial for elderly individuals and people with physical disabilities. Traditional switches often require fine motor control, bending, or moving across the room, which can be difficult for those with mobility limitations or joint pain. With this gesture-based system, appliances like fans, lights, or TVs can be operated simply by moving a hand in front of the sensor â€” no touch required. This not only reduces physical strain but also offers a more hygienic control method since it eliminates contact with shared switches, which is important for people with weakened immunity. By integrating a clear LCD menu and intuitive hand gestures, the system provides an easy, contactless, and empowering way for users to control their environment independently, enhancing comfort, safety, and quality of life.
